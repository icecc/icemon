To compile icemon, install, the icecc development package, e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu:

apt-get install libicecc-dev

Finally, make sure you have g++, Qt and qmake installed (including qmake)

apt-get install qt4-qmake 

Finally, compile and install the application:

qmake
make
make install PREFIX=/usr

Have a lot of fun ;)
